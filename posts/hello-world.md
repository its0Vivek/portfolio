Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share my thoughts on software development, game development, and my journey in tech.

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog to share my experiences and knowledge with the community. As a game developer and web enthusiast, I have a unique perspective on both worlds that I'd like to share.

## What to Expect

Here are some topics I plan to cover:
- Game Development Journey
- Web Development Tips
- Programming Best Practices
- Project Updates
- Tech Industry Insights

## Technical Stack

This blog is built with:
- Next.js for the framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Markdown for content

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
