## Key Features

I implemented several key features:
1. Dark/Light mode
2. Responsive design
3. Blog section with Markdown
4. Project showcase
5. Contact form
6. Smooth animations

## Design Philosophy

My design approach focused on:
- Clean and minimal aesthetics

## Development Process

The development process included:
1. Planning the structure
2. Creating wireframes
3. Setting up the project
4. Implementing features

6. Deployment

Building a portfolio is an ongoing process. I'll keep updating it with new projects and features!
